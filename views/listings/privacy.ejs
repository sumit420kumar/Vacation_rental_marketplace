    <h4>"Terms and Conditions"</h4> (often abbreviated as T&C, T&s, or ToS) act as a legally binding contract between a
    service
    provider (like a website or mobile app) and a user. They set the rules and guidelines that users must agree to in
    order to use or access the service.
    Here is a breakdown of what they typically entail and why they are important.
    <h4>1. Key Purposes of Terms & Conditions</h4>
    * Legal Protection: They limit the liability of the business in case of errors or issues while using the service.
    * Prevent Abuse: They allow the business to terminate accounts that spam, post abusive content, or violate
    copyright.
    * Ownership: They clarify who owns the content (logos, content, software) and what users can and cannot do with it.
    * Governing Law: They establish which country or state laws apply if a legal dispute arises.
    <h4>2. Common Clauses Included</h4>
    Most standard agreements will contain the following sections:
    * Acceptance of Terms: A statement that by using the site/app, the user agrees to the rules.
    * User Responsibilities: Rules regarding user behavior (e.g., "You must be 18+," "You cannot post hate speech").
    * Intellectual Property (IP): A declaration that the company owns its branding and content, and users cannot steal
    or reproduce it.
    * Payment & Billing: If money is involved, this section outlines subscription fees, refund policies, and payment
    methods.
    * Termination: Explanation of the grounds upon which the company can ban a user or close an account.
    * Limitation of Liability: A disclaimer stating the company is not responsible for certain damages (e.g., "We are
    not liable for data loss due to hacking").
    * Privacy Policy Reference: Often links to a separate Privacy Policy document explaining how user data is handled.
    <h4>3. Why They Matter</h4>
    * For Businesses: They provide a safety net and a clear rulebook to manage unruly users.
    * For Users: They explain what rights you have, how your data might be used (in conjunction with the Privacy
    Policy), and what to expect from the service.
    > Note: While templates exist, Terms and Conditions are legal documents. For a real business, it is highly
    recommended to have them reviewed by a legal professional to ensure they are enforceable in your specific
    jurisdiction.
